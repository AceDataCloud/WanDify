# Wan for Dify: step-by-step guide

Generate a short video and retrieve its completed file. This guide takes you from your first API key to the result in a Dify Workflow. Screenshots use Dify CE 1.17.1 in English; later versions may move the same controls.

[Read in Simplified Chinese](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/blob/main/readme/README_zh_Hans.md) · [API and pricing](https://platform.acedata.cloud/models)

## 1. Install the correct plugin

Open [Wan by acedatacloud](https://marketplace.dify.ai/plugin/acedatacloud/wan) in Dify Marketplace. Check the author is **acedatacloud**, choose **Install**, and select your Dify workspace. In your Dify workspace, open **Integrations → Tools → Tool Plugin** and select **Wan**. Its card should say **From Marketplace**.

If your Dify server cannot open Marketplace, ask its administrator to enable outbound access and plugin installation. The plugin needs HTTPS to `api.acedata.cloud`.

## 2. Get an API key with the correct access

1. Sign in at [Ace Data Cloud → Applications](https://platform.acedata.cloud/console/applications).
2. Open **General application**. Its API key can access multiple services your account is entitled to use. A service-specific key is limited to that service. For this tutorial, check **Wan** access and current pricing/balance before generating.
3. To reuse the selected key, click the copy icon marked **1** below. To create a separate Dify key, click **Manage Keys** marked **2**, then **Create**.

![Copy an existing API key or open Manage Keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/get-api-key-en.png)

4. Give the new key a name, such as `Dify tutorial`. Set expiration and usage/API restrictions only as needed, then click **Create**. Return to the key list or application card and copy the key. If **Allowed APIs** is enabled, include both the generation and task-query APIs used here: `/wan/tasks`, `/wan/videos`.

![Create an optional separate key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/create-api-key-en.png)

Copy only the token string. Do not add `Bearer `, quotation marks, or the screenshot's redacted characters. A platform management token (for example, a `platform-...` token) is not the generation API key this plugin expects. Confirm service access and a sufficient balance before the first run.

## 3. Authorize Wan in Dify

1. Open **Integrations → Tools → Tool Plugin → Wan**.
2. Click **API Key Authorization Configuration**. If an authorization already exists, click **1 Authorization** first, then the configuration button.
3. Enter an **Authorization Name**, such as `Ace Data Cloud`, and paste the copied token into **Ace Data Cloud Bearer Token**.
4. Choose who may use the credential and click **Save**. Never put a key in a prompt or workflow export.

## 4. Build your first Workflow

Open **Studio → Create → Create from Blank → Workflow**, name it, and create this path by dragging from each node's right connector to the next node:

**Start → Wan 3 Generate → Wan Retrieve Task → Output**.

Use the **+** button to add a **Tool**, select this plugin, and choose the exact action above. Rename the generation node **Wan** and the query node **Retrieve completed task** to match the screenshots. Leave Start inputs empty for this fixed first example. Keep **Retry on Failure** off on the generation node.

![Workflow connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/03-workflow.png)

Select **Wan 3 Generate** and set these fields. Leave unmentioned optional fields empty.

| Dify field | First-run value |
|---|---|
| Model (`model`) | `wan3.0-video` |
| Duration (`duration`) | `5` |
| Resolution (`resolution`) | `720P` |
| Ratio (`ratio`) | `16:9` |
| Audio (`audio`) | `false` |

**Prompt** (`prompt`):

```text
A teal cube slowly rotates on a cream tabletop, studio lighting, no text.
```

Choose **Wan 3 Generate** and `wan3.0-video`; do not accidentally select the older **Wan Generate Video** tool. This example disables generated audio.

## 5. Wait for the same task and map the result

Select **Wan Retrieve Task**. In **Task ID**, click the variable picker (or type `/`) and choose **Wan → task_id**. It must be the output variable from the generation node, not its name typed as plain text. Set **Wait up to seconds** to `240`; leave Trace ID empty for this example.

![Task ID variable binding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/04-task-id.png)

Select **Output**, click **+** to add output fields, and choose the variables below from **Retrieve completed task**:

| Output name | Select from query node | Type |
|---|---|---|
| status | status | String |
| success | success | Boolean |
| task_id | task_id | String |
| media_urls | media_urls | Array[String] |
| result | result | Object |

![Map the query outputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/05-output.png)

Click **Test Run → Start Run**. Generation may finish before the bounded wait expires; otherwise `status=pending` is normal. **Do not rerun the whole workflow while it is pending**, because that submits a new generation. Copy its task ID and create a separate **Start → Wan Retrieve Task → Output** workflow with that ID and a wait of 0 or 240. Query the same ID until `status=succeeded` and `success=true`; then open the links in `media_urls`. A green Dify workflow alone is not proof that the service task finished.

## 6. Check the expected output

A completed result has this shape (the URL below illustrates the field; use your own returned URL):

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "success": true,
  "media_urls": [
    "https://.../result.mp4"
  ]
}
```

![Actual completed Dify result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/04bcfeea981b4f5b4a3178d0119f94383c98b2fc/_assets/tutorial/06-result.png)

Actual run example; your task ID and media URL will differ.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| Authorization fails / 401 or 403 | Copy the full API token, remove `Bearer `, check service access, balance, expiration and Allowed APIs. |
| Invalid parameter / 400 | Copy the exact example model, action, resolution and JSON shape. Do not combine unrelated action fields. |
| `pending` or an empty media list | Query the same task ID again. Never regenerate just to poll. |
| HTTP 429 | Wait, reduce concurrency and check service limits; do not enable automatic paid retries. |
| Timeout / 5xx / failed task | Inspect the original task or request history before resubmitting. Contact support with task/trace ID, never your key. |
| Media link will not load | Check the task is terminal and the returned link is accessible from the Dify server/browser. |

[Download the ready-to-import workflow](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/quickstart.dify.yml). Import it in Studio, then configure your own key; the file contains no credentials.

## Privacy, cost and support

The free plugin sends your chosen inputs and token to `api.acedata.cloud`; API calls follow current service pricing. Keys stay in Dify credential storage. See [Privacy](https://github.com/AceDataCloud/WanDify/blob/main/PRIVACY.md). Only submit content you have permission to process.
